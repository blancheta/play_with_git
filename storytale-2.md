🐷 The First Little Pig
The first little pig built a house of straw.
“It’s easy and fast!” he said.
But then came the Big Bad Wolf.
“Little pig, little pig, let me come in!”
“Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!”
“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!”
The wolf blew the straw house down! The little pig ran away.
